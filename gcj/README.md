## Strategies:
- Use automated scripts for running programs on data
- Read the problem and its limits carefully!
- Use a Makefile to quickly add any special compiler settings, such as using icpc, including and linking libraries or headers with optimized code
- Do not use file parsing, use stdout, stdin and stderr
- Use the standard library
- Use relevant typedefs and defines
- Use icpc to boost performance (run a benchmark)
- If nothing else comes to mind use a brute force solution
